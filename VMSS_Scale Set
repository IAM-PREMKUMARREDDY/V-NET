What are Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)?
Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS), an interesting service offered by Microsoft Azure, helps to create and manage a set of identical, auto-scaling Virtual Machines (VMs). 
The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease based on scheduled conditions.


Auto-Scaling
Auto-scaling is a way to automatically scale up or down the number of compute resources that are being 
allocated to your application based on its needs at any given time.

Here are the most popular ways of auto-scaling:

Horizontal Scaling :
Vertical Scaling :

Vertical Scaling:
Vertical Scaling is an attempt to increase or decrease the capacity of a single machine, also called scaling up or down. 
Here the resources such as processing power, storage, memory, and more are added to an existing work unit.

Horizontal Scaling:
Horizontal Scaling is a must-use technology â€“ whenever a high availability of (server) services is required, also called scaling out and in, means adding or removing instances of a resource. 
Scaling horizontally involves adding more processing units or physical machines to your server or database

Scale-out : is the process of adding extra resources, such as virtual machines (VMs)
Scale-in :  refers to the process of reducing the number of virtual machines (VMs) in the scale set.

Autoscale Settings
An autoscale setting is read by the autoscale engine to determine whether to scale up or down.

You can create custom autoscaling rules as needed for your situation. Rule types include:

Minimum Instance: The minimum number of instances you want to deploy in your scale set.
Maximum Instances: The maximum number of instances you want to deploy while scaling out. (Note: In Azure, you can have a maximum, of 1000 instances)
Metric-based â€“ It measures application load and adds or removes VMs based on that load. For example, add an instance in a scale set when CPU usage is above 50%.
Time-based â€“ For example, trigger an instance every 8 am on Saturday in a given time zone.

Hereâ€™s a **detailed, step-by-step guide** for creating and configuring a **Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS)** 
using the Azure Portal on a free subscription account. Follow these steps to complete the task:

---

## **Step-by-Step Procedure**

---

### **1. Log in to the Azure Portal**
1. Open your browser and navigate to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Log in using your Azure account credentials (free subscription account).

---

### **2. Create a Resource Group**
1. In the search bar at the top of the portal, type **Resource groups** and select it from the results.
2. Click **+ Create**.
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Subscription**: Select your free subscription.
   - **Resource Group Name**: Enter a name like `MyResourceGroup`.
   - **Region**: Choose a region close to your location (e.g., East US).
4. Click **Review + Create**, and then click **Create** to create the resource group.

---

### **3. Create a Virtual Machine Scale Set**
1. In the search bar, type **Virtual Machine Scale Sets** and select it from the results.
2. Click **+ Create**.
3. In the **Basics** tab, provide the following details:
   - **Subscription**: Select your free subscription.
   - **Resource Group**: Select the one you just created (e.g., `MyResourceGroup`).
   - **Scale Set Name**: Enter a name like `MyScaleSet`.
   - **Region**: Select the same region as the resource group.
   - **Availability Zone**: Leave as default.
   - **Orchestration Mode**: Keep it as `Uniform`.
4. **Image**: Choose an operating system like **Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS - Gen2** (or Windows Server).
5. **Instance Size**:
   - Click **Change size**, and select a free-tier eligible VM size like `Standard_B1ls` or `Standard_B1s`.
6. **Authentication Type**:
   - For **Linux**: Choose **Password** or **SSH Public Key**.
   - For **Windows**: Use **Password**.
   - Enter a **Username** and **Password/SSH Key**.
7. **Instance Count**: Set it to `2`.
8. Click **Next: Disks**.

---

### **4. Configure Disks**
1. Use the default disk settings. The **OS disk** will be a Standard HDD.
2. Click **Next: Networking**.

---

### **5. Configure Networking**
1. Ensure a **new Virtual Network** is created automatically.
2. The **Subnet** is preconfigured.
3. Under **Load Balancer**, select **Basic** (or choose None for simplicity).
4. Click **Next: Scaling**.

---

### **6. Configure Scaling**
1. Keep the **Scaling Policy** as **Manual** for now.
2. Later, weâ€™ll set auto-scaling rules (see Step 9).
3. Click **Next: Management**.

---

### **7. Configure Management**
1. Enable the **Boot Diagnostics** option to troubleshoot if needed.
2. Leave other options as default.
3. Click **Next: Advanced**.

---

### **8. Configure Advanced Settings**
1. Leave defaults unless you need custom scripts or extensions.
2. Click **Next: Tags**.

---

### **9. Add Tags (Optional)**
1. Add tags like `Environment=Test` or `Project=VMSS` to identify resources easily.
2. Click **Review + Create**.

---

### **10. Review and Create**
1. Review all configurations. Ensure the estimated cost is within the free tier.
2. Click **Create** to deploy the VMSS.

---

### **11. Configure Auto-Scaling**
1. Once the VMSS is created, go to the resource by clicking **Go to Resource**.
2. In the left-hand menu, select **Scaling**.
3. Click **+ Add a Rule**:
   - **Metric Source**: Virtual Machine Scale Set.
   - **Metric Name**: Percentage CPU.
   - **Condition**: Greater than 75%.
   - **Action**: Increase the instance count by `1`.
   - **Cool Down**: 5 minutes.
4. Add another rule:
   - **Metric Name**: Percentage CPU.
   - **Condition**: Less than 30%.
   - **Action**: Decrease the instance count by `1`.
   - **Cool Down**: 5 minutes.
5. Save the scaling rules.

---

### **12. Test Auto-Scaling**
1. Access one of the VMs in the scale set:
   - Go to **Instances** under the VMSS.
   - Select an instance and click **Connect** (via SSH or RDP).
2. Stress the CPU:
   - For Linux, install `stress` using:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install stress
     stress --cpu 8 --timeout 300
     ```
   - For Windows, run a CPU-intensive task in PowerShell.
3. Monitor the **Instances** tab in the VMSS to see if new instances are added.

---

### **13. Clean Up Resources**
1. Once youâ€™ve completed the task, delete the resource group to avoid charges:
   - Go to **Resource Groups** in the portal.
   - Select `MyResourceGroup`.
   - Click **Delete Resource Group**, type the name to confirm, and delete.

---

### **Deliverables:**
- Screenshot of your VMSS in the Azure portal.
- Screenshot of the auto-scaling activity (new instances being created or removed).
